# Features Directory

Feature planning documents created by `/ct:feature-plan` command.

## Structure:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md` - Feature specifications
- `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/` - Task breakdown directories
  - `task-001.xml`, `task-002.xml` - Sequential tasks
  - `task-003/` - Parallel task groups with subtasks

## Workflow:
1. Feature analysis and documentation
2. Task breakdown with XML tracking
3. Implementation with progress monitoring
