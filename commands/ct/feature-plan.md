# Feature Planning and Analysis System

Interactive feature planning command that prompts for new features, analyzes them for completeness and clarity issues, and creates structured feature documentation with multi-agent validation.

## Usage

```bash
/ct:feature-plan                    # Interactive feature planning session
/ct:feature-plan --quick           # Skip detailed validation for rapid prototyping
/ct:feature-plan --vision-only     # Focus only on vision alignment
```

## Options
- `--quick`: Skip detailed cross-agent analysis for faster feedback
- `--vision-only`: Only validate against VISION.md, skip other compliance checks
- `--skip-interaction`: Process feature without interactive clarification (for automated workflows)

## Feature Analysis Process

The feature planning system uses a multi-agent approach to ensure features are well-defined, clear, and aligned with project goals:

### Phase 1: Feature Collection
1. **Interactive Prompting**: Gather initial feature description from user
2. **Context Discovery**: Analyze existing project structure, VISION.md, requirements.md
3. **Initial Assessment**: Quick review for obvious gaps or issues

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Analysis
1. **üéØ /ct:agent:compliance-vision** - Vision Alignment Analysis
   - Validates feature fits project scope and scale (CLI/desktop/web/enterprise)
   - Prevents scope creep and ensures appropriate complexity
   - Checks against VISION.md requirements

2. **üìã /ct:agent:compliance-spec** - Specification Clarity Analysis
   - Identifies vague, ambiguous, or unclear requirements
   - Flags missing technical details and acceptance criteria
   - Ensures feature is testable and measurable

3. **üîç /ct:agent:reality-check** - Feasibility and Reality Assessment
   - Cuts through unrealistic expectations
   - Validates technical feasibility within project constraints
   - Identifies potential implementation challenges

4. **üìã /ct:agent:compliance-rules** - Project Rules Compliance
   - Validates against AGENTS.md guidelines
   - Checks XML rule files (./docs/llm/rules/*.xml, .claude/rules/*.xml)
   - Ensures feature aligns with project standards

### Phase 3: Interactive Clarification
- **Issue Identification**: Present analysis findings to user
- **Clarification Loop**: Interactive Q&A to resolve ambiguities
- **Refinement**: Iterative improvement until feature is well-defined
- **Final Validation**: Confirm feature meets all clarity requirements

### Phase 4: Documentation Creation
- **Feature File Creation**: Generate dated feature file in `./docs/planning/features/`
- **Design Integration**: Link to existing design.md if present
- **Business Case**: Include use cases and business value
- **Implementation Breakdown**: Break large features into sub-features

### Phase 5: Task Workflow Generation
- **üîß /ct:agent:feature-workflow** - Implementation Task Breakdown
  - Creates hierarchical task structure with XML tracking
  - Generates actionable, specific implementation tasks
  - Establishes task dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
  - Produces machine-readable task files for progress monitoring

## Feature Analysis Framework

### Clarity Issues Detected
- **Vague Requirements**: "Make it better" ‚Üí "Improve response time by 50%"
- **Ambiguous Scope**: "Add user management" ‚Üí "Add user registration, authentication, and profile management"
- **Missing Context**: Feature without business justification or use cases
- **Open-Ended Goals**: "Optimize performance" ‚Üí "Reduce API response time from 2s to 500ms"
- **Undefined Success**: No measurable acceptance criteria
- **Technical Gaps**: Missing implementation details or constraints

### Business Validation
- **Use Case Analysis**: Who will use this feature and why?
- **Value Proposition**: What business problem does this solve?
- **User Stories**: Concrete scenarios for feature usage
- **Success Metrics**: How will we measure feature success?
- **Priority Assessment**: Where does this fit in project roadmap?

## Success Criteria

A feature is considered implementation-ready when:
- **Clear Requirements**: Specific, measurable, and testable
- **Business Justification**: Clear use cases and value proposition
- **Technical Feasibility**: Realistic within project constraints
- **Vision Alignment**: Serves stated project goals appropriately
- **Task Breakdown**: Actionable tasks with dependencies and success criteria
- **Machine Trackable**: XML task structure enables automated progress monitoring

The feature planning system ensures no feature enters development without proper analysis, clarification, and actionable implementation roadmap, preventing scope creep, over-engineering, and unclear requirements that lead to project delays and confusion.
